Spa Tec's instructions to clean mold and mildew from vinyl spa and hot tub covers:

1. Remove foam cores from the vinyl encasement by opening hidden zippers in hinge area. 
   NOTE: Do not puncture or scuff the plastic vapor barrier surrounding the foam inserts.
2. Mix two gallons of water, a teaspoon of mild hand dishwashing soap like Dawn and one cup of bleach in a bucket    to create solution.
3. With a soft bristle brush, scrub the outside of the encasement 
   thoroughly with mixed cleaner, let it sit and re apply mix in problem areas as needed.
4. Hose off and - Turn the vinyl encasement inside out, repeat cleaning process.
5. Wipe down foam cores with a wash cloth and mixed solution. 
6. Rinse both well and stand cores up to dry.. 
7. Place the encasement in the sun and foam cores in the shade to dry. (Do not put foam cores in the sun, they    will melt!)
8. Once everything is dry, spray the cores and inside the vinyl encasement with a mildew inhibitor like Pine    Sol®. 
9. Allow everything to dry completely.
10. Reassemble. 
11. Spray exterior only vinyl with a U.V. inhibiting type automotive vinyl sealer to repel sun damage and     staining.
    Note: Make sure to maintain proper water chemistry to avoid mildew from returning.
