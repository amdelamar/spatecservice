1. Remove Spa cover and place exterior up on a flat surface such as a deck, cement pad or other well drained    surface.
2. Drizzle mild hand dishwashing soap like Dawn onto vinyl encasement.
3. Lightly spray with water from garden hose.
4. Scrub surface with a soft bristle brush or soft bristle floor broom.
5. Rinse with garden hose to see results and repeat until satisfied.
6. Flip cover over and repeat process. Do not stress hinged area of cover.
7. Stand cover up and rinse entire cover again until soap suds disappear.
   NOTE: If soap suds enter into spa (Hot Tub) vessel when reinstalling you will have a suds problem in the water    after turning spa back on. Be sure cover is soap suds free prior to reinstalling...
8. Allow cover exterior to dry thoroughly.
